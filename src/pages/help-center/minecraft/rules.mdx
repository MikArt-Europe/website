# Server Rules
By connecting to or pinging our Minecraft server, you automatically accept these rules, TOS, and Privacy Policy.


## Here are the shortened rules for our Minecraft server (request in Discord):
1. The regulations outlined herein diverge from those governing our Discord server.
2. Disrupting the enjoyment of other participants constitutes a punishable transgression.
3. Threats, whether explicit or implied, are strictly prohibited. Fostering a congenial atmosphere is
imperative for the cohesion of our server community.
4. Actively engaging in sabotage is proscribed. Varied degrees of sabotage elicit commensurate disciplinary measures.
Should an instance of sabotage occur within a designated area, the proprietor of said locale is enjoined to promptly
notify the administrative personnel.
5. Player versus player (PVP) interactions are permissible provided they
remain consonant with all other stipulations delineated herein.
6. The administrative staff retains full authority to modify your status,
as well as pertinent town and user data, in instances where such action is deemed requisite.
7. Instances of illegitimate wealth accumulation, unless of a significant magnitude and designated as a matter for
staff intervention, shall not warrant punitive measures. Efforts shall be undertaken, where feasible, to restore a
substantial portion of misappropriated funds.
8. Exploiting lapses in the internal mechanics of the server consequent to staff error is proscribed. Any infractions
pertaining to financial matters shall be subject to the regulations outlined under the provision #6.
9. Engaging in cheating via third-party software clients is deemed a transgression meriting punitive action.
10. Accounts demonstrably linked through shared IP addresses or confirmed as under common ownership shall be subject
to identical disciplinary measures. We understand that sometimes multiple accounts may share an IP address due to
reasons beyond your control, such as family members or roommates. We try not to penalize you for the actions of others
in your household. If you believe you have been unfairly penalized due to shared IP addresses or common ownership,
please follow the instructions on reporting issues for further assistance. Moreover, actions qualifying as punishable
offenses may be aggregated and attributed to a single account, as determined by the discretion of the administrative staff.
11. Please refrain from promoting external servers, communities, or products within the Minecraft server,
including but not limited to Discord servers, websites, or third-party services.
Any efforts to advertise will lead to disciplinary action as determined by the administrative staff.
12. Soliciting other players to teleport (TP) under false pretenses, such as offering loot or assistance,
with the intention of causing harm or initiating an unwarranted Player versus Player (PVP) interaction, is strictly prohibited.
This rule is in place to maintain a fair and respectful gaming environment. Violations will be subject to disciplinary action as
determined by the administrative staff.
13. The impersonation of other players, staff members, or any individual is strictly prohibited. This includes,
but is not limited to, the use of similar usernames, false claims of identity, or any form of misrepresentation.
This policy is implemented to uphold trust and authenticity within our community. Violations of this rule will
result in disciplinary actions as deemed appropriate by the administrative staff.
14. All operational directives must adhere to the terms delineated within
the Minecraft End User License Agreement (EULA) and the prescribed Usage Guidelines
as specified on the official Minecraft website.
