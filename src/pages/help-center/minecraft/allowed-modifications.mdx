# Allowed Modifications

Some parts of these rules are done with inspiration from [Hypixel's allowed modifications](https://support.hypixel.net/hc/en-us/articles/6472550754962-Hypixel-Allowed-Modifications).

<Callout type="warning">
    **Warning**:
    Before using any modifications please be aware that all use of modifications on our server is at your own risk,
    including the ones we list as examples in this guide. We cannot review every version of every modification,
    and as such we cannot provide any guarantees of modifications being within our server rules.

# Allowed modifications
These types of mods you **can** use on our server:

Modifications that are purely cosmetic and do not give any advantage in gameplay.
This includes mods that change the appearance of blocks, items, or entities,
as well as mods that add new blocks, items, or entities that do not have any special abilities.

## Armor & Effect Status HUDs
Mods that display the status of armor and effects on the screen are allowed.


Although this may be considered an advantage in a sense,
it doesn't give players any physical advantages in a fight.
Theyâ€™re killed the same way and do the same amount of damage.

## Client Optimisation Mods
Client modifications with the main goal of improving client FPS (Frames Per Second).
This includes mods that reduce the amount of resources used by the client, such as **Optifine**.

Modifications that have the primary objective of improving the player to have an
improved experience when playing Minecraft in terms of the game's playability (e.g. FPS improvements).
Optifine is a popular example of one of these modifications,
which optimizes the way Minecraft operates to improve frame rates,
as well as offering more customizable "Video Settings".

## Clients & Modpacks (Including Only Allowed Modifications)
Clients and modpacks that contain a list of useful mods are allowed.

### Lunar Client, Badlion Client, and other clients
Minecraft client mods (sometimes made available as self-contained clients)
that contain a variety of modifications grouped together into a single package are permitted,
provided the included modifications are permitted on our server by themselves.

**Please note that this does not include cheat / "hack" clients or similar,
any use of which is against our rules.**
