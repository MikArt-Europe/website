## Introduction

These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the EnSave Discord bot ("Bot"), provided by EnSave ("Company", "we", "us", or "our"). By accessing or using the Bot, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms, then you do not have permission to access the Bot.

## Use License

1. Permission is granted to temporarily download one copy of the Bot for personal, non-commercial transitory viewing only. This is the grant of a license, not a transfer of title, and under this license, you may not:

a. Modify or copy the materials;
b. Use the materials for any commercial purpose, or for any public display (commercial or non-commercial);
c. Attempt to decompile or reverse engineer any software contained in the Bot;
d. Remove any copyright or other proprietary notations from the materials; or
e. Transfer the materials to another person or "mirror" the materials on any other server.

2. This license shall automatically terminate if you violate any of these restrictions and may be terminated by the Company at any time. Upon terminating your viewing of these materials or upon the termination of this license, you must destroy any downloaded materials in your possession whether in electronic or printed format.

## Modifications to Terms

The Company reserves the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. If a revision is material, we will provide at least 30 days' notice prior to any new terms taking effect. What constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole discretion.
