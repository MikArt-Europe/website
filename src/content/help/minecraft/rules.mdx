Here are the shortened rules for our Minecraft server:
1. The regulations outlined herein diverge from those governing our Discord server.
2. Disrupting the enjoyment of other participants constitutes a punishable transgression.
3. Threats, whether explicit or implied, are strictly prohibited.
Fostering a congenial atmosphere is imperative for the cohesion of our server community.
4. Actively engaging in sabotage is proscribed. Varied degrees of sabotage
elicit commensurate disciplinary measures. Should an instance of sabotage occur within a
designated area, the proprietor of said locale is enjoined to promptly notify the administrative personnel.
5. Player versus player (PVP) interactions are permissible provided they remain consonant with all
other stipulations delineated herein.
6. The administrative staff retains full authority to modify your status,
as well as pertinent town and user data, in instances where such action is deemed requisite.
7. Instances of illegitimate wealth accumulation, unless of a significant magnitude
and designated as a matter for staff intervention, shall not warrant punitive measures.
Efforts shall be undertaken, where feasible, to restore a substantial portion of misappropriated funds.
8. Exploiting lapses in the internal mechanics of the server consequent to staff error is proscribed.
Any infractions pertaining to financial matters shall be subject to the regulations outlined
under the provision #6.
9. Engaging in cheating via third-party software clients is deemed a transgression meriting punitive action.
10. Accounts demonstrably linked through shared IP addresses or confirmed as under common
ownership shall be subject to identical disciplinary measures. Moreover, actions qualifying as
punishable offenses may be aggregated and attributed to a single account,
as determined by the discretion of the administrative staff.
11. The decision-making prerogatives of staff members shall not be influenced by
personal sentiment or subjective inclinations.
12. All operational directives must adhere to the terms delineated within
the Minecraft End User License Agreement (EULA) and the prescribed Usage Guidelines
as specified on the official Minecraft website.
