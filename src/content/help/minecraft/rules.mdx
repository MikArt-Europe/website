1. These rules are not the same as our Discord server rules.
2. Ruining other players' experience is considered a punishable offense. Having a nice time is essential for our server community.
3. Griefing is not allowed. Different stages of griefing have different stages of punishment. If an event occurs where a place is griefed, the area's owner should contact staff.
4. PVP is allowed when it doesn't break any other rules.
5. Staff has all the right to change your status, town data, user data if its deemed necessary
6. Illegal ways of money gathering when it's not a massive, and it's a staff issue will not be a bannable offense. A big portion of "stolen" money will be set back if possible.
7. If a staff member makes a failure in internal server features, abusing it isn't allowed. Any money related offenses will follow rule ME#5.
8. Cheating with 3rd party clients is considered a punishable offense.
9. Accounts that can be connected with each other (e.g. same ip, proved to be same ownership) will receive the same punishment. Also, an action that can be considered a punishable offense can be totaled and added to only one of the account, if staff thinks that.
10. Staff members aren't allowed to make decisions just on their feelings or personal thinking.
11. All actions must follow https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/eula and https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/usage-guidelines.
