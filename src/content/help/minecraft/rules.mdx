1. The regulations outlined herein diverge from those governing our Discord server.

4. Player versus player (PVP) interactions are permissible provided they remain consonant with all other stipulations delineated herein.
5. The administrative staff retains full authority to modify your status, as well as pertinent town and user data, in instances where such action is deemed requisite.
6. Instances of illegitimate wealth accumulation, unless of a significant magnitude and designated as a matter for staff intervention, shall not warrant punitive measures. Efforts shall be undertaken, where feasible, to restore a substantial portion of misappropriated funds.
7. Exploiting lapses in the internal mechanics of the server consequent to staff error is proscribed. Any infractions pertaining to financial matters shall be subject to the regulations outlined under the provision #6.
8. Engaging in cheating via third-party software clients is deemed a transgression meriting punitive action.

10. The decision-making prerogatives of staff members shall not be influenced by personal sentiment or subjective inclinations.
11. All operational directives must adhere to the terms delineated within the Minecraft End User License Agreement (EULA) and the prescribed Usage Guidelines as specified on the official Minecraft website.
