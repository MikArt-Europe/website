# How to create a public home

To create a public home, you must first have a home set. If you do not have a home set, you can set one by typing `/sethome (name)`. Once you have a home set, you can make it public by doing `/edithome (name) privacy public`.

This will make your home public and allow other players to visit your home. If you want to make your home private again, you can do `/edithome (name) privacy private`.
