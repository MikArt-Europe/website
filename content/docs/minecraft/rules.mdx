## General

- Disrupting the enjoyment of other participants constitutes a punishable transgression.
- Threats, whether explicit or implied, are strictly prohibited. Keeping things friendly is super important for our server community.
- The use of profanity, vulgarity, or any form of offensive language is proscribed and may most likely result in a mute.
- Knowingly benefiting from another player's rule violations may result in penalties.
- Actions that technically comply with the letter of the rules but violate their spirit may still be subject to moderation.
- All operational directives must adhere to the terms delineated within the Minecraft End User License Agreement (EULA)
  and the prescribed Usage Guidelines as specified on the official Minecraft website.

### Communication

- External promotion of servers, communities, products, or services is prohibited within the Minecraft server.
- Impersonation of other players, staff members, or any individual is strictly forbidden.
- Harassment, bullying, or targeted attacks against any player are not tolerated, including but not limited to:
- Persistent unwanted contact after being asked to stop
- Intimidation tactics or threats
- Following a player around the server with malicious intent
- Hate speech, discriminatory language, or derogatory comments based on race, ethnicity, gender, religion, sexual orientation, nationality, disability, or any other personal characteristic are strictly prohibited.
- Sharing personal information of others (doxxing) or pressuring players to reveal personal details is forbidden.
- Spamming, flooding chat, or deliberately disrupting conversations is not allowed.
- Deliberately spreading false information about the server, players, or staff is prohibited.
- Attempting to bypass chat filters or moderation actions through alternative methods or accounts will result in increased penalties.
- Excessive drama, argumentative behavior, or intentionally provoking conflict between players is discouraged.
- Overly personal or intimate relationships that make others uncomfortable are inappropriate for this community environment.

## Exploits

Exploiting bugs, glitches, or any other unintended mechanics within the game is strictly prohibited. For example, but not limited to:

- Duplication of items.
- Using bugs to gain an unfair advantage.
- Finding a loophole in server shop to gain money.

Instances of illegitimate wealth accumulation shall be subject to disciplinary action as determined by the administrative staff,
which may include the confiscation of ill-gotten gains and the imposition of additional penalties as warranted. The administrative staff
reserves the right to determine the severity of the infraction and the appropriate course of action.

_Also note that the use of any client modifications that grant you an unfair advantage over other players is strictly prohibited._

## Griefing and Sabotage

- Actively engaging in sabotage is proscribed. Varied degrees of sabotage elicit commensurate disciplinary measures.
  Should an instance of sabotage occur within a designated area, the proprietor of said locale is enjoined to promptly
  notify the administrative personnel.

Some examples of sabotage include but are not limited to:

- The destruction of someone's property, even if it is not claimed.
- Placing a lot of TNT blocks next to someone's claims even when blowing them up is not intended. This is considered griefing
  since you're making the area a lot ugly and create a high risk of the TNT's exploding, maybe due to a mistake or a creeper.

## PVP

- Player versus player (PVP) interactions are permissible provided they
  remain consonant with all other stipulations delineated herein.
- Soliciting other players to teleport (TP) under false pretenses, such as offering loot or assistance,
  with the intention of causing harm or initiating an unwarranted Player versus Player (PVP) interaction, is strictly prohibited.
  This rule is in place to maintain a fair and respectful gaming environment. Violations will be subject to disciplinary action as
  determined by the administrative staff.

## User Safety and Wellbeing

- Engaging in activities that could significantly impact user safety, fundamental rights, or wellbeing is strictly prohibited within the Minecraft server environment.
- Impersonating professionals or claiming expertise in specialized fields such as legal, medical, or financial domains is forbidden.
- Collecting, soliciting, or attempting to extract personal information from other players under any pretense is strictly prohibited.
- Disseminating content that promotes or encourages systemic prejudice, marginalization, or discrimination against individuals or groups is strictly forbidden.
- Engaging in politically divisive discussions, including but not limited to:
- Political lobbying or campaigning
- Targeted profiling of specific individuals or demographic groups
- Spreading misleading information concerning real-world elections or political processes
- Attempting to influence or discourage individuals from participating in democratic processes
- Exploiting vulnerabilities in server systems or other players' accounts with malicious intent constitutes a severe violation.
- Creating, sharing, or promoting content that could reasonably be expected to cause significant distress, harm, or negative impact on other participants' mental wellbeing is expressly prohibited.
- The administrative staff reserves the right to evaluate and take appropriate action against any behavior deemed to compromise the safety or wellbeing of the community, regardless of whether such behavior is explicitly enumerated herein.

# Information related to punishments

- Accounts demonstrably linked through shared IP addresses or confirmed as under common ownership shall be subject
  to identical disciplinary measures. We understand that sometimes multiple accounts may share an IP address due to
  reasons beyond your control, such as family members or roommates. We try not to penalize you for the actions of others
  in your household. If you believe you have been unfairly penalized due to shared IP addresses or common ownership,
  please follow the instructions on reporting issues for further assistance. Moreover, actions qualifying as punishable
  offenses may be aggregated and attributed to a single account, as determined by the discretion of the administrative staff.
- The administrative staff retains full authority to modify your status,
  as well as pertinent town and user data, in instances where such action is deemed requisite.

# Staff Guidelines

These are some staff guidelines set in place to ensure that the staff team is professional and fair. But they are not limited to:

1. Staff members are obligated to maintain a consistently professional demeanor in all interactions and conduct within the community.
2. Staff members are mandated to strictly adhere to the identical rules and regulations
   as those applied to regular players, without exception or privilege.
3. The decision-making prerogatives of staff members must remain uninfluenced by personal sentiment,
   subjective inclinations, or any factors external to the established guidelines and policies.
4. Staff members are entrusted with upholding the integrity and fairness of the community at all times,
   and are expected to exercise sound judgment and discretion in all matters concerning their roles and responsibilities.
5. Staff members must prioritize transparency and accountability in their actions, ensuring that all decisions and
   interventions are clearly communicated and justified, when necessary, to the community stakeholders.
6. Staff members are expected to continuously engage in self-improvement and professional development,
   seeking to enhance their skills, knowledge, and understanding of community dynamics and best practices in moderation and administration.
7. Staff members are required to maintain confidentiality regarding sensitive information and internal
   deliberations, safeguarding the privacy and trust of community members and colleagues alike.
