Panoptic is a powerful and flexible event management plugin for Minecraft servers.

Whether you want to welcome new players with custom messages, reward players for certain achievements, or run maintenance tasks on a schedule, Panoptic has you covered.

## What can you do with Panoptic?

- **React to player events**: Send messages, run commands, or cancel actions when players join, break blocks, craft items, and much more
- **Schedule automated tasks**: Set up recurring events using cron expressions or simple intervals
- **Create conditional logic**: Use placeholders, check player stats, or add random chances to make your events dynamic
- **Control event frequency**: Set cooldowns to prevent spam and manage how often events trigger
- **Integrate with other plugins**: Works seamlessly with PlaceholderAPI and MiniPlaceholders

## Getting Started

### Building from Source
First, clone the [repository](https://github.com/ArikSquad/panoptic) and build the project:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ArikSquad/panoptic.git
cd panoptic
mvn clean install
```

### Installation
1. Take the JAR file from the `target` directory and place it in your server's `plugins` folder
2. Start your serverâ€”Panoptic will create a `panoptic` folder in your plugins directory
3. Inside this folder, you'll find an `events` directory where all your event configurations live

### Your First Event
Let's create a simple welcome message for new players. Create a file called `player_join.yml` in the `plugins/panoptic/events/` directory:

```yaml
listen: true
events:
  - conditions: []
    actions:
      - type: send_message
        value: "Welcome to our server, %player%! Enjoy your stay!"
```

That's it! Now every time a player joins, they'll see a personalized welcome message.

## Configuration Structure

All events follow the same basic structure:
- **listen**: Whether this event type should be processed
- **events**: A list of event configurations, each with conditions and actions

Each event can have:
- **conditions**: Requirements that must be met for the actions to run
- **actions**: What should happen when the conditions are satisfied
- **conditionEvaluationMode**: How multiple conditions should work together (REQUIRE_ALL, REQUIRE_ANY, REQUIRE_SINGLE)
- **perPlayerCooldown**: Minimum time between triggers for each player (in milliseconds)
- **globalCooldown**: Minimum time between triggers across all players (in milliseconds)

### Advanced Event Example
Here's a more sophisticated event that shows off some advanced features:

```yaml
listen: true
events:
  - conditions:
      - type: block_type
        value: "DIAMOND_ORE"
      - type: world
        value: "mining"
    conditionEvaluationMode: "REQUIRE_ALL"
    perPlayerCooldown: 30000  # 30 seconds per player
    globalCooldown: 5000      # 5 seconds globally
    actions:
      - type: send_message
        value: "&6Diamond found! Next reward available in 30 seconds."
      - type: run_command_as_console
        value: "give %player% emerald 2"
```
