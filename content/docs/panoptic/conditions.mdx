title: Conditions
---

Conditions are the "if" statements of Panoptic. They let you create smart events that only trigger when specific requirements are met. Want to give rewards only to players in a certain world? Or maybe send different messages based on what time it is? Conditions make it all possible.

## Basic Usage
Conditions are defined as a list under the `conditions` key in your event configuration:

```yaml
conditions:
  - type: world
    value: "survival"
  - type: sneaking
```

Some conditions need a `value` to specify what to check for, while others (like `sneaking`) work without any additional setup.

## Condition Evaluation Modes

By default, **all conditions must be true** for actions to run (AND logic). But you can change this behavior with the `conditionEvaluationMode` setting:

### REQUIRE_ALL (Default)
All conditions must be true. This is the standard AND logic.

```yaml
events:
  - conditions:
      - type: world
        value: "survival"
      - type: sneaking
    conditionEvaluationMode: "REQUIRE_ALL"  # Optional - this is the default
    actions:
      - type: send_message
        value: "You're sneaking in survival!"
```

### REQUIRE_ANY
At least one condition must be true. This gives you OR logic.

```yaml
events:
  - conditions:
      - type: world
        value: "survival"
      - type: world
        value: "creative"
    conditionEvaluationMode: "REQUIRE_ANY"
    actions:
      - type: send_message
        value: "Welcome to survival or creative mode!"
```

### REQUIRE_SINGLE
Exactly one condition must be true. This is XOR logic - useful when you want mutually exclusive conditions.

```yaml
events:
  - conditions:
      - type: sneaking
      - type: world
        value: "pvp"
    conditionEvaluationMode: "REQUIRE_SINGLE"
    actions:
      - type: send_message
        value: "Either you're sneaking OR you're in PVP world (but not both)!"
```

### REQUIRE_NONE
No conditions are required - actions always execute. Useful for events that should always trigger.

```yaml
events:
  - conditions:
      - type: world
        value: "ignore_this"
    conditionEvaluationMode: "REQUIRE_NONE"
    actions:
      - type: send_message
        value: "This always runs regardless of conditions!"
```

## Cooldowns

Prevent event spam and control frequency with cooldowns:

### Per-Player Cooldown
Each player has their own cooldown timer:

```yaml
events:
  - conditions:
      - type: block_type
        value: "DIAMOND_ORE"
    perPlayerCooldown: 60000  # 60 seconds per player
    actions:
      - type: send_message
        value: "Diamond mining reward! (Once per minute per player)"
```

### Global Cooldown
Affects all players - once triggered, no player can trigger it again until the cooldown expires:

```yaml
events:
  - conditions:
      - type: entity_type
        value: "ENDER_DRAGON"
    globalCooldown: 300000  # 5 minutes for everyone
    actions:
      - type: send_message
        value: "Dragon slain! Server-wide celebration!"
```

### Combined Cooldowns
Use both for fine-grained control:

```yaml
events:
  - conditions:
      - type: random
        value: "0.01"  # 1% chance
    perPlayerCooldown: 30000   # 30 seconds per player
    globalCooldown: 5000       # 5 seconds globally
    actions:
      - type: send_message
        value: "Rare event triggered!"
```

## Available Conditions

### sneaking
Checks if the player is currently sneaking (holding shift).

```yaml
- type: sneaking
```

**Real example**: Secret reward for sneaky players
```yaml
# In block_break.yml
listen: true
events:
  - conditions:
      - type: sneaking
      - type: block_type
        value: "DIAMOND_ORE"
    actions:
      - type: send_message
        value: "<light_purple>Secret bonus for sneaky miners!"
      - type: run_command_as_console
        value: "give %player% diamond 2"
```

### world
Checks if the event happened in a specific world.

```yaml
- type: world
  value: "world_nether"
```

**Real example**: Nether-specific welcome message
```yaml
# In player_teleport.yml
listen: true
events:
  - conditions:
      - type: world
        value: "world_nether"
    actions:
      - type: send_message
        value: "<red>Welcome to the Nether! <gold>Be careful of the lava!"
```

### random
Adds a chance element to your events. The value should be between 0.0 (never) and 1.0 (always).

```yaml
- type: random
  value: "0.1"  # 10% chance
```

**Real example**: Random fishing rewards
```yaml
# In fish_catch.yml
listen: true
events:
  - conditions:
      - type: random
        value: "0.05"  # 5% chance
    actions:
      - type: send_message
        value: "<aqua><bold>🐟 RARE CATCH! <reset><yellow>You caught something special!"
      - type: run_command_as_console
        value: "give %player% enchanted_golden_apple 1"
```

### placeholder
Checks PlaceholderAPI placeholders against specific values. Requires PlaceholderAPI to be installed.

**Supported operators:**
- `=` - equal to
- `!=` - not equal to
- `>` - greater than
- `<` - less than
- `>=` - greater than or equal to
- `<=` - less than or equal to

```yaml
- type: placeholder
  value: "%vault_eco_balance%>=1000"
```

**Real example**: VIP perks for wealthy players
```yaml
# In player_join.yml
listen: true
events:
  - conditions:
      - type: placeholder
        value: "%vault_eco_balance%>=50000"
    actions:
      - type: send_message
        value: "<gold><bold>VIP <reset><yellow>Welcome back, wealthy player!"
      - type: run_command_as_console
        value: "give %player% golden_apple 5"
```

### mini_placeholder
Similar to placeholder but uses MiniPlaceholders instead. Requires MiniPlaceholders to be installed.

```yaml
- type: mini_placeholder
  value: "%server_tps%>18.0"
```

### entity_type
Checks the type of entity involved in the event. Mainly useful for damage and death events.

```yaml
- type: entity_type
  value: "CREEPER"
```

**Real example**: Special message for creeper deaths
```yaml
# In player_death.yml
listen: true
events:
  - conditions:
      - type: entity_type
        value: "CREEPER"
    actions:
      - type: send_message
        value: "<green><bold>💥 BOOM! <reset><gray>That's what you get for hugging creepers!"
```

### block_location
Checks if a block event happened at a specific location. Format: `world,x,y,z`

```yaml
- type: block_location
  value: "world,100,64,200"
```

**Real example**: Protect a specific block
```yaml
# In block_break.yml
listen: true
events:
  - conditions:
      - type: block_location
        value: "spawn,0,65,0"
    actions:
      - type: send_message
        value: "<red>You cannot break the spawn monument!"
      - type: cancel
```

### block_at_location
Checks what type of block is at the player's current location.

```yaml
- type: block_at_location
  value: "WATER"
```

**Real example**: Swimming detection
```yaml
# In move.yml
listen: true
events:
  - conditions:
      - type: block_at_location
        value: "WATER"
    actions:
      - type: send_message
        value: "<aqua>You're swimming! Don't forget to breathe!"
```

## Advanced Examples

### Multi-World OR Logic
Welcome players to any of several worlds:

```yaml
# In player_teleport.yml
listen: true
events:
  - conditions:
      - type: world
        value: "survival"
      - type: world
        value: "creative"
      - type: world
        value: "adventure"
    conditionEvaluationMode: "REQUIRE_ANY"
    actions:
      - type: send_message
        value: "<green>Welcome to one of our main worlds!"
```

### Exclusive Rewards
Reward either new players OR VIPs, but not both:

```yaml
# In player_join.yml
listen: true
events:
  - conditions:
      - type: placeholder
        value: "%luckperms_has_permission_panoptic.newplayer%=false"
      - type: placeholder
        value: "%vault_eco_balance%>=10000"
    conditionEvaluationMode: "REQUIRE_SINGLE"
    perPlayerCooldown: 86400000  # 24 hours
    actions:
      - type: send_message
        value: "<gold>Special reward for either new players OR rich players!"
      - type: run_command_as_console
        value: "give %player% diamond 5"
```

### Anti-Spam Mining Rewards
Prevent players from spamming diamond mining for rewards:

```yaml
# In block_break.yml
listen: true
events:
  - conditions:
      - type: block_type
        value: "DIAMOND_ORE"
      - type: world
        value: "mining"
    perPlayerCooldown: 120000  # 2 minutes per player
    globalCooldown: 10000      # 10 seconds globally
    actions:
      - type: send_message
        value: "<gold>Mining bonus! <gray>(Available again in 2 minutes)"
      - type: run_command_as_console
        value: "give %player% emerald 3"
```

### Time-Based Events with Cooldowns
Daily login rewards that only work once per day:

```yaml
# In player_join.yml
listen: true
events:
  - conditions:
      - type: placeholder
        value: "%server_time_H%>=6"
      - type: placeholder
        value: "%server_time_H%<12"
    conditionEvaluationMode: "REQUIRE_ALL"
    perPlayerCooldown: 86400000  # 24 hours
    actions:
      - type: send_message
        value: "<yellow>Good morning! Here's your daily reward!"
      - type: run_command_as_console
        value: "give %player% bread 32"
```

## Tips and Tricks

- **Testing**: Use the `/panoptic reload` command to test your condition changes quickly
- **Debugging**: Add temporary `send_message` actions to see when conditions are being met
- **Performance**: Random conditions are very lightweight, so don't worry about using them frequently
- **Cooldown Values**: Times are in milliseconds (1000 = 1 second, 60000 = 1 minute)
- **Evaluation Modes**: REQUIRE_ANY is great for multi-world events, REQUIRE_SINGLE for exclusive rewards

**Note**: The `placeholder` and `mini_placeholder` conditions might be unified in a future update since they work very similarly.
