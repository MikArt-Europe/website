Conditions are used to check if a player has certain information attached to them, such as checking a placeholder, entity types, or other conditions.
They are used in various places, such as in the `if` action, to determine if a certain action should be executed.

## Usage
```yaml
- type: <condition_type>
  value: <value> # only on types that require a value, otherwise including this field will cause an error
```
