title: Actions
description: Actions are the heart of Panoptic—they're what actually happens when your events trigger. Whether you want to send a message, run a command, or even cancel an event entirely, actions make it possible.
---

## Basic Usage
Actions are defined as a list under the `actions` key in your event configuration:

```yaml
actions:
  - type: send_message
    value: "Hello %player%!"
  - type: run_command_as_console
    value: "give %player% diamond 1"
```

Some actions need a `value` field to specify what they should do, while others (like `cancel`) work without any additional configuration.

## Placeholders and Context

Most actions have access to information about what triggered them. You can use these placeholders in your action values:

- `%player%` - The player's name
- `%player_uuid%` - The player's unique ID
- `%block_type%` - The type of block involved (for block events)
- `%block_location%` - Where the block is located (format: `world,x,y,z`)
- `%event_name%` - The name of the event that triggered this action

**Example**: A mining reward system
```yaml
# In block_break.yml
listen: true
events:
  - conditions:
      - type: block_type
        value: "DIAMOND_ORE"
    actions:
      - type: send_message
        value: "<gold>Lucky find! You mined %block_type% at %block_location%"
      - type: run_command_as_console
        value: "give %player% emerald 5"
```

## Available Actions

### send_message
Sends a message directly to the player who triggered the event. Supports MiniMessage formatting for colors and styles.

```yaml
- type: send_message
  value: "<green>Welcome back, %player%! <gray>You're in world: <yellow>%world%"
```

### run_command_as_player
Executes a command as if the player typed it themselves. Useful for commands that need player context.

```yaml
- type: run_command_as_player
  value: "spawn"
```

**Real example**: Auto-teleport players who fall into the void
```yaml
# In player_damage.yml
listen: true
events:
  - conditions:
      - type: entity_type
        value: "VOID"
    actions:
      - type: send_message
        value: "<red>Oops! Teleporting you to safety..."
      - type: run_command_as_player
        value: "spawn"
```

### run_command_as_console
Runs a command from the console with full administrative privileges. Perfect for giving items, changing permissions, or running other admin commands.

```yaml
- type: run_command_as_console
  value: "give %player% golden_apple 1"
```

**Real example**: Reward system for first-time joiners
```yaml
# In player_join.yml
listen: true
events:
  - conditions:
      - type: placeholder
        value: "%luckperms_has_permission_panoptic.newplayer%=false"
    actions:
      - type: send_message
        value: "<gold>Welcome to our server! Here's a starter kit!"
      - type: run_command_as_console
        value: "give %player% bread 10"
      - type: run_command_as_console
        value: "give %player% wooden_sword 1"
      - type: run_command_as_console
        value: "lp user %player% permission set panoptic.newplayer true"
```

### cancel
Prevents the original event from happening. For example, you can stop a player from breaking certain blocks or joining under specific conditions.

```yaml
- type: cancel
```

**Real example**: Protect spawners in certain worlds
```yaml
# In block_break.yml
listen: true
events:
  - conditions:
      - type: block_type
        value: "SPAWNER"
      - type: world
        value: "survival"
    actions:
      - type: send_message
        value: "<red>You cannot break spawners in the survival world!"
      - type: cancel
```

## Advanced Examples

### Random Reward System
Give players a chance at rare rewards when mining:

```yaml
# In block_break.yml
listen: true
events:
  - conditions:
      - type: block_type
        value: "STONE"
      - type: random
        value: "0.001"  # 0.1% chance
    actions:
      - type: send_message
        value: "<gold><bold>✦ RARE DROP! <reset><yellow>You found a hidden treasure!"
      - type: run_command_as_console
        value: "give %player% diamond 3"
```

### Smart Welcome Messages
Different welcome messages based on the time of day:

```yaml
# In player_join.yml
listen: true
events:
  - conditions:
      - type: placeholder
        value: "%server_time_H%>=6"
      - type: placeholder
        value: "%server_time_H%<12"
    actions:
      - type: send_message
        value: "<yellow>Good morning, %player%! ☀️"
  - conditions:
      - type: placeholder
        value: "%server_time_H%>=12"
      - type: placeholder
        value: "%server_time_H%<18"
    actions:
      - type: send_message
        value: "<gold>Good afternoon, %player%! 🌤️"
  - conditions:
      - type: placeholder
        value: "%server_time_H%>=18"
    actions:
      - type: send_message
        value: "<blue>Good evening, %player%! 🌙"
```

## Tips and Tricks

- **MiniMessage Format**: Use `<color>` tags like `<red>`, `<green>`, `<bold>`, `<italic>` for formatting
- **Multiple Actions**: You can have as many actions as you want in a single event
- **Order Matters**: Actions execute in the order you list them
- **Testing**: Use the `/panoptic reload` command to test your changes without restarting the server
