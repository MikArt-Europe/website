# Configuration

## Structure

The configuration files are YAML files that contain all the configuration options for your server.
They're used to set up the GroupSecurity instance and customize its behavior.

📁 The configuration files are located in the directory `/plugins/GroupSecurity`.

- 📄 `config.yml`: The main configuration file.
- 📄 `messages-xx-xx.yml`: Language files for messages. Formatted in MiniMessage. See [more info](https://docs.advntr.dev/minimessage/format)

<Files>
    <Folder name="GroupSecurity" defaultOpen>
        <File name="config.yml"/>
        <File name="messages-xx-xx.yml"/>
    </Folder>
</Files>

## Walkthrough

### `language`

The language of the messages. The default is `en-us`, but you can change it to any of these:

- `en-us`
- `en-gb`
- `se-se`
- `fr-ca`
- `fi-fi`

### `debug`

Whether to enable debug mode. This will print additional information to the console which are not useful for most people. I don't recommend enabling this if you don't know what you're doing.

### `update_checker`

Whether to enable the plugin's update checker. This will check for updates on startup.

### `database`

The database settings. This is where you can configure the database connection.

### permission_handler

Default: `AUTO`, this will choose Vault in spigot, and force LuckPerms in proxy. Possible values here are:

- `AUTO` (preferred)
- `LUCKPERMS` (preferred)
- `VAULT`

### use_permissions

Whether to use permissions to show autocompletions and other stuff. Use this if you want to restrict normal players from seeing GroupSecurity commands.
Default: `false` (recommended on true)

### secure

The secure settings. This is where you can configure the security engine and other security-related settings.

#### type

The security engine to use. Possible values are:

- `NO_COMMANDS`
- `PERMISSIONS_AFTER`

#### allow_moving

Whether to allow moving and using commands without logging in. Default: `true`

#### ip_check

Not written yet.

#### auto_logout_time

Not written yet.

#### kick_unknown_ips

Whether to kick unknown ips. ipCheck must be enabled for this to work. Default: `true`

#### max_tries

The maximum number of tries a player has to login before being kicked. Default: `10`

#### actions_on_max_tries

Example syntax:

```yaml
actions_on_max_tries:
    - KICK;<red>You have reached the maximum number of login attempts. Please try again later.
```

Find out the full syntax in the [Actions section](#actions).

#### actions_on_failed_login

Actions to run when a player fails to login. Find out the full syntax in the [Actions section](#actions).

#### actions_on_login

Actions to run when a player logs in. Find out the full syntax in the [Actions section](#actions).

#### password

Settings that apply for the password mode. These are pretty straight forward.

- `min_length`: The minimum length of the password. Set to -1 to disable.
- `max_length`: The maximum length of the password. Set to -1 to disable.
- `require_uppercase`: Whether to require at least one uppercase letter.
- `require_lowercase`: Whether to require at least one lowercase letter.
- `require_number`: Whether to require at least one number.
- `require_special`: Whether to require at least one special character.
- `hashing`: The hashing solution to use. The default is `BCRYPT`, because of it's speed.

Here's a table what you can use and their differences:

| Property      | BCRYPT      | Argon2         | Scrypt      |
|---------------|-------------|----------------|-------------|
| Strength      | 🟢 Strong   | 🔵 Very Strong | 🟢 Strong   |
| Speed         | 🟠 Slow     | 🟠 Slow        | 🟠 Slow     |
| Memory Usage  | 🟢 Low      | 🔴 High        | 🔴 High     |
| CPU Usage     | 🟢 Low      | 🔴 High        | 🔴 High     |
| GPU Resistant | ✅ Yes       | ✅ Yes          | ✅ Yes       |
| Hashing Type  | 🔄 Adaptive | 🔄 Adaptive    | 🔄 Adaptive |
| Notes         | 👍 Good     | 🏆 Best        | 👍 Good     |

##### argon2
- `memory`: The amount of memory to use in KB. Default is 65,536 (64MB).
- `iterations`: The number of iterations to use. Default is 3.
- `parallelism`: The parallelism to use. Default is 1.

##### scrypt
* `memory`: The amount of memory to use in KB. Default is 65,536 (64MB).
* `iterations`: The number of iterations to use. Default is 16,384
* `parallelism`: The parallelism to use. Default is 1.

#### pin
Settings that apply for the pin mode. These are pretty straight forward.
* `length`: Set to -1 to disable, or to set bounds, set this to -1 and set min_length and max_length
* `min_length`: The minimum length of the pin. Set to -1 to disable.
* `max_length`: The maximum length of the pin. Set to -1 to disable.
* `can_be_straight`: Set's if the pin can be the numbers next to each other. Only works in the length is less than 9

### webhook

The webhook settings. This is where you can configure the webhook connection.

#### enabled

Whether to enable the webhook. This will send messages to a discord channel.

#### url

The URL of the webhook.

#### send_failed_login

Whether to send a message when a player fails to login.

#### send_login

Whether to send a message when a player logs in.

#### send_auto_login

Whether to send a message when a player logs in automatically through IP.

#### login_message

The message to send when a player logs in. See more about the variables in the [webhook messages](#webhook_messages) section.

#### fail_message

The message to send when a player fails to login. See more about the variables in the [webhook messages](#webhook_messages) section.

#### ip_failure_message

The message to send when a player tries to join auto-authenticated from an unknown IP-address. See more about the variables in the [webhook messages](#webhook_messages) section.

#### max_tries_message

The message to send when a player has reached the maximum number of login attempts. See more about the variables in the [webhook messages](#webhook_messages) section.

#### auto_login_message

The message to send when a player has been auto-authenticated with GroupSecurity. See more about the variables in the [webhook messages](#webhook_messages) section.

### platform

The platform settings. This is where you can configure the platform settings.

#### bungee

- `bungee_brigadier_emulation_experiment`: Whether to enable experimental brigadier emulation. This is experimental, and may not work as expected. We recommend you to use Velocity.

### disabled_commands

The commands to disable. This is useful if you want to disable certain commands from being registered. For example, if you want to disable the `/resetpassword` command, you can add it to this list.

```yaml
disabled_commands:
    - resetpassword
```

## Webhook messages

- `<name>`: The name of the player.
- `<uuid>`: The UUID of the player.

_You are free to suggest new variables to be added to the webhook messages. Just open an ticket on our Discord!_

## Actions

Example syntax:

```yaml
actions_on_max_tries:
    - KICK;<red>You have reached the maximum number of login attempts. Please try again later.
```

The format is `<action>;<message>`, where `<action>` is the action to take and `<message>` is the message to send. The action can be one of the following:

- `KICK`
- `COMMAND`
- `MESSAGE`
