# Making an additional engine

You are able to create your own engines with the API

## Creating a new engine

To create a new engine, you need to extend the `PasswordEngine` class. This will require you to override these two methods:

- `void createPassword(OnlineUser player, String password)`: This method is called when a player creates a new password. You can use this method to create a new password for the player.
- `boolean validatePassword(OnlineUser player, String password)`: This method is called when a player tries to log in. You can use this method to check if the password is correct.

Example:

```java
public class PinCode extends PasswordEngine {
	public PinCode(IGroupSecurity plugin) {
		super(plugin, "pin");
	}

	@Override
	public void createPassword(OnlineUser player, String password) {
		if (registered(plugin, player)) return;

		plugin.getDatabase().setPassword(player.getUuid(), password);
		player.sendMessage(plugin.getLocales().getOrFallback("pin_registered"));
		plugin.getDatabase().setRegistered(player.getUuid(), true);
	}

	@Override
	public boolean validatePassword(OnlineUser player, String password) {
		return plugin.getDatabase().getPassword(player.getUuid()).equals(password);
	}
}
```

## Registering the engine

With the engine created, you can now register it with the API. You can do this in your `onEnable` (or any equivalent) method:

```java
@Override
public void onEnable() {
    GroupSecurityAPI api = GroupSecurityAPI.getInstance();
    api.registerEngine((plugin) -> new PinCode(plugin));
}
```
