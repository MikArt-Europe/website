# config.yml
## General Settings

These are the general settings the plugin offers you to configure. Please learn about yaml before editing the configuration since yaml doesn't tolerate any errors.

### language: (str)

The setting for locale. Possible values: `en-us`, `fi_fi`

```yaml
language: en-us
```

### debug: (bool)

The first option is a boolean which makes the plugin print debugging info to the console.

```yaml
debug: false
```

### update_checker: (bool)

Here you can set if you want to check for new updates. If it's set to true, it will tell if new updates are available for download.

```yaml
update_checker: true
```

## Effect settings

All the settings for all effects. You can configure them how you like.

### lightning:

```yaml
lightning:
    # Will the time set to night with the effect? Default: true
    night: true
```

### particle:

Configure what particle will be used when using particle as the effect and how many particles will be spawned upon vanishing.


```yaml
