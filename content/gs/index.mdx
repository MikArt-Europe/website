# Overview
GroupSecurity is an upcoming Minecraft plugin for Velocity, Spigot and Bungeecord. It has been used at MikArt Europe's Earth SMP server since December 2023.

## Installation
Please choose a provider where to download the plugin:

Polymart:

BuiltByBit:

Hangar: (when premium support is available)

Spigot: (most likely not going to be published here)

After downloading the jarfile, please place the file in your server's plugin folder and start your server.
A folder called `groupsecurity` should have been created in the plugins folder, you can use configuration files found
in that folder to customize the GroupSecurity experience.

Depending on where you downloaded the plugin, you may need to configure your licensing in the `loader.yml` file.

## Most notable features
### Proxy support
You can use this plugin on **Velocity** & **Bungeecord** (and their forks)

### Fabric & NeoForge authentication mod
We have developed a novel method to use a Fabric (or NeoForge) mod for automatic authentication using cryptographically signed keys.
This approach enhances security and mitigates the risk of key theft unless malware compromises your machine.
