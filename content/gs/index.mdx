Current planned maintaining until: **December 2025**

> [!NOTE]
>
> There are no plans to stop maintaining this plugin. I have added this to show I will maintain the plugin at least for that time, if you're hesitating on getting our plugin due to many people doing plugins on "pump & dump"

## Installation
Please choose a provider where to download the plugin:

Spigot:

Hangar:

Polymart:

BuiltByBit:

GitHub:

After downloading the jarfile, please place the file in your servers plugin folder and start your server. A folder called `groupsecurity` should have been created in the plugins folder, you can use configuration files found in that folder to customize the GroupSecurity experience.

## Most notable features
### Proxy support
You can use this plugin on **Velocity** & **Bungeecord** (and their forks)

### Fabric authentication mod
We have developed a new groundbreaking way to use a fabric mod to authenticate automatically using cryptographically signed keys. This is far more secure and can't be stolen except your machine getting malware.
