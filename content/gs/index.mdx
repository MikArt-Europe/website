## Most notable features
### Proxy support
You can use this plugin on **Velocity** & **Bungeecord** (and their forks)

### Fabric authentication mod
We have developed a novel method to use a fabric mod for automatic authentication using cryptographically signed keys.
This approach enhances security and mitigates the risk of key theft unless your machine is compromised by malware.
